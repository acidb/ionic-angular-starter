The Mobiscroll CLI will take care of cloning and installing the necessary plugins and tools for this starter.

Open a terminal window (command prompt) and run the following commands:

$ mobiscroll start ionic-angular

$ ionic serve

This (ionic serve) will run the ionic project in browser. For testing the app on a device or emulator run:

$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios

You can do the same for Android by substituting ios for android.
